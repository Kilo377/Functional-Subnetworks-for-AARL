# testbench

In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the structure and usage of `testbench.py`. This testing framework is designed to systematically validate the response characteristics and approximation performance of each arithmetic functional subnetwork (Adder, Multiplier, and Differentiator). It also supports hierarchical testing of compositional structures, such as "addition followed by multiplication" and "multiplication followed by differentiation."

The FSN modules can be either simulated in a standard environment or deployed directly on Loihi hardware. To support both backends, we define a global simulation toggle:

```python
# Global simulator switch: True for Loihi backend, False for standard Nengo simulation
USE_LOIHI = True  # or False
```

To thoroughly assess the approximation capability and dynamic behavior of each FSN under varying input conditions, we designed a series of simulation experiments that include all basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, differentiation). In addition, we implemented several simple compositional structures to evaluate multi-stage functional performance.

## Single Module test

### Adder

In the validation experiment for the Adder subnetwork, we used a sine function and a constant signal as inputs. Specifically, the first input is given by  $x(t) = \sin(2\pi t)$, and the second input is a constant $y(t) = 0.5$. This combination was intentionally chosen because the sine function introduces continuously varying periodic dynamics, while the constant input provides a steady offset. Together, they form a signal that contains both high-frequency and low-frequency components.

By summing these two inputs, we are able to observe the FSN Adder’s linear response under varying input magnitudes, especially around zero crossings and amplitude extrema, where decoding accuracy is typically more sensitive. The expected output is simply the sum of the two inputs, which is analytically tractable and thus easy to evaluate against the FSN output.

Based on the results from both the standard Nengo simulator and actual deployment on Loihi, we provide preliminary evidence that the FSN Adder module is functionally effective and deployable within spiking neural systems. In the Nengo simulator, the FSN output closely matches the analytical target function (sine plus constant), exhibiting smooth waveforms and accurate phase alignment. On the Loihi backend, although the overall trend still follows the expected curve, the output contains noticeable high-frequency disturbances and irregular fluctuations. These artifacts are presumed to stem from the discrete nature of spiking neuron encoding. Overall, both sets of results demonstrate successful approximation of the addition operation. However, the Loihi-based implementation does exhibit certain noise-related limitations, including localized oscillations, peak deviations, and phase jitter.

### Multiplier

The multiplier was tested using a pair of piecewise constant input signals, each exhibiting step changes at specific time points. Specifically, the first input changes values at  $t = 0, 2.5, 4$ seconds, while the second input switches at $t = 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5$ seconds. All values lie within the range $[−10,10]$, simulating bounded numerical conditions for evaluating the interaction between the two signals.

This input design was chosen to tightly control the experimental variables, making the resulting multiplication output predictable and analyzable in well-defined segments. Such structure allows for clear assessment of the network’s ability to approximate nonlinear functions under steady-state conditions.

![mul_loihi.png](testbench%2020904b3f519f805dac0af7b3188696a8/mul_loihi.png)

In the simulation tests of the multiplier subnetwork, we examined the FSN module’s output response to piecewise constant inputs and compared it to the theoretical ground truth, which is the pointwise product of the two input signals. The left panel shows the results from the standard Nengo simulator, where the output curve remains relatively smooth and closely follows the expected stepwise transitions of the product. Notably, the FSN output adjusts its magnitude promptly at transition points, maintaining accurate amplitude tracking and overall stability.

In contrast, the right panel presents results from the Loihi simulation backend. While the FSN output still roughly follows the target trajectory, more pronounced fluctuations and high-frequency noise are evident—particularly near transition boundaries where the inputs change sharply. This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the limitations of spiking neurons in approximating nonlinear functions with high precision, as well as to integration errors and spike timing irregularities inherent in the spiking encoding process.

Nevertheless, the FSN multiplier successfully reconstructs the essential structure of the input product, demonstrating reliable approximation under steady-state input conditions. However, compared to the adder, the multiplier’s inherently nonlinear nature makes it more susceptible to noise amplification, and its accuracy is more sensitive to neuron distribution and structural parameters. As such, when deploying on Loihi, careful parameter tuning and additional filtering mechanisms may be required to improve robustness and numerical precision.

### Differentiator

The differentiator was tested using a sinusoidal input signal with a frequency of 1 Hz, given by $x(t) = \sin(2\pi t)$. Its analytical derivative is $x'(t) = 2\pi \cos(2\pi t)$, which exhibits well-defined periodicity and amplitude. The alternating sign of the derivative across time makes it particularly suitable for evaluating both the accuracy and phase alignment of the FSN output.

This test allows us to assess the differentiator’s ability to respond to smooth, continuously varying inputs. Specifically, it provides insight into the network’s responsiveness, delay-related errors, and its capacity to reliably track the slope of the input signal over time.

![diff_loihi.png](testbench%2020904b3f519f805dac0af7b3188696a8/diff_loihi.png)

In the simulation results of the differentiator subnetwork, we evaluated the FSN’s ability to approximate the derivative of a continuously varying signal, using a sine function as input and expecting an analytical output corresponding to its derivative—a scaled cosine function. In the left panel, which shows results from the standard Nengo simulator, the FSN output closely follows the shape of the expected derivative across the entire time range.

The right panel shows the output from the Loihi backend. Compared to the Nengo simulation, the FSN’s derivative estimates exhibit some localized fluctuations and deviations in detail. However, these discrepancies appear less pronounced than those observed in the adder and multiplier networks, which is somewhat surprising and raises further questions regarding the interaction between network dynamics and signal properties.

Despite such local instabilities, the FSN differentiator successfully reproduces the overall trend of the input signal’s slope at the macroscopic level. In particular, the amplitude transitions during the rising and falling phases of the sine wave are directionally consistent with the expected derivative. These results indicate that the differentiator subnetwork demonstrates a meaningful capacity for approximating temporal derivatives in spiking neural systems.

## Composite Module Test

### Addition Followed by Multiplication (ADD → MUL)

One of the composite tests uses two linearly increasing signals as inputs: $a(t)=t，b(t)=2$. These are first fed into the adder to compute $a + b = 3t$, and the result is then passed to the multiplier along with $b(t)$, yielding a theoretical output of $3t \cdot 2t = 6t^2$.

This setup is deliberately structured: the use of monotonically increasing linear inputs helps avoid the influence of nonstationary noise, providing a stable basis for evaluation. Furthermore, the operation chain—from addition to multiplication—captures the interaction between linear and nonlinear components within the FSN architecture, offering a comprehensive test of multi-stage network composability.

![combination_loihi.png](testbench%2020904b3f519f805dac0af7b3188696a8/combination_loihi.png)

The left panel shows the output from the standard Nengo simulator. The FSN network produces a result that closely matches the expected function over the entire time interval. The output curve is smooth and continuous, and particularly in the region beyond $t>2$ seconds, the FSN network is able to reliably track the rapid growth of the function, indicating good compositional accuracy between the adder and multiplier modules when arranged in series.

The right panel presents the results obtained from the Loihi simulator. While the overall trend remains correct, noticeable error accumulation and response lag begin to appear in the high-growth region beyond $t>3t$ seconds. The FSN output is slightly lower than the analytical result and exhibits more pronounced noise and fluctuations.

This experiment provides a straightforward validation of the structural composability of FSN modules.

### Multiplication Followed by Differentiation (MUL → DIFF)

Another key composite experiment uses two time-dependent functions as inputs: $a(t)=t，b(t)=2t$. Their product is $ab = 2t^2$, and the expected derivative is $\frac{d}{dt}(2t^2) = 4t$. In this experiment, the two inputs are first fed into the multiplier to produce $2t^2$, and the result is then passed to the differentiator. The objective is to examine how closely the FSN output aligns with the theoretical curve $4t$

Unfortunately, this part of the design did not perform as expected.

In summary, the above tests highlight the differences between FSN performance in simulation and actual deployment on Loihi, and they provide preliminary validation of the functional viability of the FSN framework. While the results demonstrate the potential of FSNs in arithmetic computation, they also underscore that parameter tuning remains a significant challenge in achieving optimal performance on neuromorphic hardware.
